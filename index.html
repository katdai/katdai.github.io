                    NFL Big Data Bowl 2024: Uncovering missed tackle opportunities</a></b>
                    <br> We built an XGBoost model to predict tackle probability and find missed tackle opportunities. 
                    We also evaluated players by how often they generate tackle opportunities and miss tackles.

                    <br> I built an analysis engine to tabulate 70k+ survey responses and test for statistically significant differences between different response groups.
                    <br> Immensely proud of how the increased speed of analysis allowed the team to present the first report with extensive findings for women of different races.
